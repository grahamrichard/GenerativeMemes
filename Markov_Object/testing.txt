    From 1945 to 1949, what has become known as the Great Famine ravaged Ireland. The failure of the potato, Ireland’s staple food source, heralded years of starvation and disease for the Irish population. As the blight began to spread, the Conservative government in England, led by Prime Minister Robert Peel, took measures to ensure that the populace wouldn’t starve. Grain, specifically corn and meal from the United States, was imported into Ireland and sold at cost. Through subsidies, the government encouraged the formation of local relief committees to aid the poor. Lastly, the Peelite government implemented public works schemes, although concern about government meddling with the free market depressed the workers’ wages. After the Peelite government was replaced by John Russel’s Whig government, policy towards Ireland shifted to match free market ideology. The importation of grain ceased, and the public works schemes, now funded by taxing the Irish landed class, were emphasized as a means to help the starving poor. As the famine worsened, soup kitchens opened and the government administered outdoor relief. However, people who owned more than a quarter of an acre of land were denied aid, and the relief others received did little to stop starvation. By the end of the famine, around a quarter of Irelands population of 8 million had either died or emigrated. In the face of this mass starvation, why did the British government due so little to alleviate the terrible conditions in Ireland? Whig and to a lesser extend Conservative adherence to classical liberal, free market ideology explains the British government’s seeming ambivalence to the famine. The Whig government strictly believed in non-intervention with the free market. Therefore, selling food at cost, banning food exports, and public works that paying above the market rate were unthinkable. Others viewed the famine as a way to transform Irish society, replacing Irish landlords with a wealthy middle class of Capitalists. The strict adherence to laissez-faire ideology and the desire to transform Ireland dictated the actions of those in charge of Irish policy during the Great Famine.
	Ireland’s dependence on the potato as a staple food source is what made it so uniquely susceptible to the blight. By the early 19th century, approximately two-thirds of the Irish population consumed potatoes as their primary food source. Depending on the county, the diet of some of the Irish poor was exclusively potato based. Farmers also fed their animals potatoes, meaning that a potato blight would be devastating for livestock as well as the general population. These conditions ensured that Ireland was uniquely unprepared for the Great Famine. A huge portion of the Irish population were Cottier farmers that depended upon the potato for sustenance and income. If the potato failed, not only would the Irish lose their largest form of sustenance and income, but livestock would suffer as well, leaving the Irish without food or money.
	The English considered the potato a lesser food source in comparison to corn or wheat. To many in Britain, “Diet was the bench-mark of civilization and those dependent on the potato were in a debased and savage state.” Free trade ideologues in the British parliament also viewed the potato as impractical. Potatoes were not easy to store as they took up more space than grains, and they rotted in the hulls of ships, making international trade all but impossible. For those that desired to change Irish society to be more in line with Britain, one of Ireland’s key failings was its dependence on the potato as its staple food source. If Ireland was to become more like England, the Irish would have to change their diets from potatoes to grains.
	 Prior to the famine, laissez-faire ideology was accepted by the British elite as the best means of individual and national improvement in Ireland. Conservative leader Robert Peel believed that the Irish and English economies needed to be joined. This “for Peel, was the desired end of Irish policy by the 1840s.” Similarly, John Russel of the Whig party believed in “a wholesale transformation of Irish society: smallholders effectually forced into becoming paid laborers, a Catholic middle class that would constitute a secure and prudent body of tenant-farmers, and insolvent landlords replaced by wealthy Irish middle-class capitalists.”To both the Conservatives and the Whigs, transforming Irish society to be more in line with England was what dictated policy.
	The fungus phythopthora infestans, first seen in the United States in 1843, arrived in Ireland in 1845 with devastating consequences. At first the true scale of the blight was unknown, as it had arrived late into the season. Half of harvest was still saved, and measures instituted by the Peelite government to stop widespread distress ensured that a massive famine would not happen. However, a near complete failure of the potato crop in 1846 and again in 1847 devastated Ireland. The Cottiers that farmed the potato were left without their primary income.  Unable to grow or buy food, many people began to starve, or die of disease resulting from malnutrition.
	Peel’s response to the crisis had varying success. To counteract the Potato failure, Peel eliminated the Corn Laws, tariffs that taxed imported grains. While this move did allow for cheaper alternatives to the potato, it also showed Peel’s desire for a transformation of Ireland into a free trade economy. The repeal of the Corn Laws undoubtedly hurt Ireland’s grain producers, as they could not rival the prices of international competitors, but Peel argued that a gradual shift from potato to grain consumption would help the Irish overall. The elimination of the corn laws was controversial, and hurt Peel politically. Going against his free trade interests, Peel imported £100,000 worth of corn, which he sold to the Irish population at cost value. While this decision seemingly went against Peel’s long term interests of changing Ireland, this importation allowed the people of Ireland to grow accustomed to having corn as a staple food source, which was beneficial to Peel’s long-term goals. Repealing the corn laws and importing grain did help prevent mass starvation in Ireland, but they also benefited Peel as he had larger goals of transforming Irish society.
	The second element of Peel’s relief strategy was to subsidize the donations of local elites within Ireland. These local relief committees gave monetary aid to the poor, as well as distributed food at reduced or even no price. To encourage this, the British government subsidized the aid given by the committees. There was a popular sentiment in Britain that “Irish property must pay for Irish poverty” and these measures followed that line of thinking to a certain extent. While the British government encouraged private charity through subsidies, they weren’t the Irish were still paying for their own relief. While private donations were generous, especially amongst religious communities like the Quakers, as the famine worsened, charity did little to stem the tide of starvation and disease within Ireland.
	Lastly, in an effort to help the Irish poor pay for food, the Peelite government implemented various public works projects. Public works schemes were not new to Ireland as they had been used during other food shortages. However, while the public work schemes that Peel implemented could have helped, they were hamstrung by the free market ideology that Peel subscribed to. In an effort to not disturb the local markets, wages for public work schemes had to be less than local wages. While this theoretically encouraged workers to pursue other means of employment, it actually meant that the laborers either had to get food on lines of credit from merchants or starve. While public works schemes had been implemented successfully in the past, the conservative government’s fear of meddling with the free market limited their use during the early years of the Great Famine.
	Peel’s government fell in 1846, and was replaced by the divided Whig party, led by John Russel. The Whig party were free-market ideologues that believed that the government shouldn’t interfere with the market in any way. While Peel had similar beliefs, his grain import showed that he was at least somewhat of a pragmatist. The Whig party was much more ideological, and their policies reflected a slavish devotion to the free market and moralist thought regarding Ireland. The moralist segment of the Whig party believed in implementing free market policies as a means of moral improvement within Ireland. This viewpoint was best exemplified with Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Wood’s description of the famine as “a calamity sent by Providence.” Throughout their years in power, the Whigs were split between the moderates like John Russel and the moralists like Wood and Charles Trevelyan. While some of their policies were similar to Peel’s, others reflected the moralist strain within the party.
	The famine was undoubtedly worse under the Russell years, but the Whig party proceeded to eliminate the subsidized grain that Peel had introduced. 90 percent of the potato crop failed in 1966, in comparison to only half in 1965 and starvation was rampant. Selling corn at cost price had been an effective way of combating starvation, but the Whig government eliminated that policy for fear that it interfered with the market too much. What remaining grain the government held was sold at market price and the import and export of grains was left to the Irish merchants. The Whig government had hoped that the free market would ensure that the poor had affordable food, but in reality prices skyrocketed and some grain that was produced in Ireland was exported to other countries. Whig policy during the Great Famine reflected their devotion to free-market ideology; they eliminated Peelite policy that interfered with the free market and relied on merchants to supply affordable food to the starving poor.
	The Whigs placed public works as the central pillar of their relief policy, but their restrictive and punitive regulations ensured that the poor would not be able to make enough money to eat. While Peel had funded the relief works entirely through government funds or loans, the new public works were half funded with loans with the other half paid by local taxpayers. The Moralists within the Whig party also wanted the relief works to have a punitive component, so they could act as “a sort of test like the workhouse.” While this measure was mostly opposed by the Whig moderates, conditions did worsen, relief was lessened and the poor were still unable to pay for food. The Whigs also implemented “piece of work” payments for the workers, a measure that paid laborers for how much work they completed, rather than how long they worked. This caused many of the already weak laborers to work themselves to the point of exhaustion or death. The scale of the famine also obstructed the public works system from providing proper relief. While Peel’s system had employed some 100,000 laborers, that number grew to 750,000 at its peak under Whig rule. Administrating the relief works was a nearly impossible task, and it slowed down the process of providing relief when the laborers needed it most. The Whig relief works system was a failure as its punitive and restrictive nature placed too much of a burden on its workers. Instead of helping, the relief schemes overworked an already starving population.
	After the failure of the public works schemes, Russel’s government introduced soup kitchens, which limited but did not entirely stop mass death and starvation. Soup kitchens had been run privately throughout the Great Famine, but the charity was too small to effectively combat the blight. The Destitute Poor Act was the first Whig policy that directly gave the starving poor the food they needed. While the kitchens were only in operation during the summer of 1847, they fed up to 3 million. This was also the most interventionist of the Whig relief policies. Counter to the public works schemes, where the starving poor were paid low wages as to not upset the market, the soup kitchens gave food away for free, directly interfering with free market prices. There were still regulations on who was eligible for the rations, but in practice, many were fed. Ultimately, creating soup kitchens was the most successful Whig policy regarding the famine. The kitchens did not eliminate starvation completely, but they did provide much needed food for the starving poor.
	The Whig government abandoned the soup kitchens in September 1847, Choosing instead to extend existing poor laws with the Poor Law Amendment act. This act created outdoor relief for the destitute as well as the able bodied if the workhouses were full. In an effort to localize relief, the government declared that localities were to pay for the relief in full. The British government and press increasingly targeted Irish landlords as responsible for Irish poverty, and “Irish property paying for Irish poverty” continued to be a popular sentiment within the British government and public. As a concession to the landlords, an amendment known as the Gregory Clause was passed, stating that those who held more than a quarter of an acre of land were ineligible for relief. This amendment was especially controversial as it would be used to remove farmers from estates, as small farmers would have to give up their plots of land to be eligible for any sort of relief. Despite protests, the government passed the Poor Law act, effectively making Ireland responsible for any famine relief. The expansion of the poor laws showed the Whig government’s hesitance at providing extended relief in Ireland through government subsidies. The Gregory clause also demonstrated how little the Whigs seemed to care about the Cottier class. While the Cottiers were destitute, they would not receive aid. The soup kitchens had been a success, but the Whigs closed the kitchens in favor of policies that saved the government money, while also punishing the Cottier farmers.
	Throughout the Whig government’s tenure, their policies showed an ideological adherence to strict capitalist principles. The Whigs showed their faith in the free market immediately when they repealed Peel’s corn policies. Instead of the government providing cheap grain to the starving poor, the Whig’s believed that the free market would correct the problems. This faith can also be seen in other Whig policies throughout the famine. Other countries like Portugal had banned merchants from exporting food during the their respective famine, but the British government freely allowed the exportation of food while prices in Ireland were skyrocketing. Similarly, the public works schemes were failures as they were too punitive and didn’t pay laborers enough. The laborers were overworked and unable to pay for food, essentially making the works schemes useless. While the soup kitchens did violate the Whigs’ free market principles, they were quickly replaced with poor law reforms that transferred most of the famine relief responsibilities to the Irish themselves, and punished Irish with small plots of land. The Whigs were strict ideologues regarding the free market, valuing the market’s purity over the wellbeing of the Irish population.
	The Whigs also used the famine as a means to change Irish society. The Moralists within the Whig party saw the famine as a result of the “moral failings” of the Irish. According to the moralists, “The lack of any exertion towards self-help, ‘improvident’ living on the potato, and fatalism” were all reasons why the Irish suffered so much during the Great Famine. Seen through a Moralist lens, the punitive measures of the public works schemes, emphasizing grains as the staple of Irish diets, and making “Irish property pay for Irish poverty” were all measures that contributed to the betterment of Irish society. While Moralists did play a significant role in shaping Irish policy, they weren’t the only faction within the Whigs. Moderate pragmatists like Russel also desired to transform Irish society, but they didn’t view the famine as divine punishment. Instead, the moderates tried to implement policies that would transform Ireland into a free market state, similar to the rest of Britain. Russell’s overall goal was for Ireland to “emerge as a paler version of the apparently harmonious English countryside.” Either through moralist or capitalist ideology, the Whigs used the famine as a way to transform Ireland as they saw fit.
	Throughout the Great Famine, the British government under both Peel and Russell implemented policies that would further the ideological goals of the ruling party. While Peel wasn’t as ideological as the Whigs, his repeal of the corn laws demonstrated a desire to bring free trade to Ireland. While Peel did believe in the free market, he was also pragmatic. His decision to sell corn at cost price showed that he wasn’t a strict ideologue, and he would sacrifice his greater vision to help the starving poor. While his corn subsidies were successful, his other policies, namely the public work schemes, were handicapped by his ideology. Workers were paid little as to not interfere with the market and had to get food on lines of credit. While Peel had hoped that the public work schemes would help people make enough money to sustain themselves, were paid too little to subsidize the increasing price of food. After the Whigs took control of the British government, famine policy became more ideological and punitive. Throughout the famine, Whig policies showed a clear moralist and free market ideology. Moralists within the party believed that the famine was both a punishment for Irish backwardness and an opportunity to transform it in their image. Punitive relief measures were enacted that did little to help the starving poor, and actually contributed to malnourishment and death. The Whigs abandoned Peelite policies that went against the free market, and left the import and export of food completely unregulated. Through their policies Whig leaders like Russell hoped to transform Ireland into a free market society similar to England. The hardline ideology of both the moralists and the moderates is seen in all of their policies. To some, the government’s actions regarding Ireland seemed cruel and irrational, but both the Whigs and the Conservatives enacted policies that were completely in line with their respective ideologies.
